Membership of the Hackspace
===========================

Any person over the age of 18 can join the hackspace, by visiting on a open night, providing correct details and setting up and maintaining a monthly payment into our nominated bank account.

The amount you pay into the Hackspace is your own choice, however we ask that you contribute more than you take away, for information; **the average costs per hour to run the hackspace can be seen on our** `Cost of hacking page <http://nottinghack.org.uk/tools/costposter/>`_ .

Should you bring guests to the Hackspace regularly, please **ensure your membership fees cover their access** and usage of the Hackspace.

Members are expected to make a worthy minimum monthly contribution to the space in order to be entitled to store a Hackspace provided 35 litre box (provided at cost by the Hackspace to ensure all boxes can easily stack).  Members using the large storage areas are expected to make a similarly worthy minimum monthly contribution.  This contribution can be monetary or in terms of time or effort spent improving the space through the various Hackspace Teams.

It's worth noting that all members of the Hackspace, and the Trustees included, recognise that **not** all valueable contributions to the space will be monetary.  This will be taken in to consideration by the Trustees, however a member who is felt to be taking more from the space than they are contributing may be asked by the elected Trustees to contribute a more suitable amount.  If the member in question does not balance their contribution in a timeline set out by the Trustees, a grievence process may be started which may lead to the termination of membership to the Hackspace for the member in question.

When a member stops paying their standing order, they will become an Ex-Member. **An ex member will be provided notification of such**, and if they have one, **their members box will be emptied** within 2 months of the last standing order payment. In order to abide by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, all Ex-members with projects or gear in the Hackspace will be served with a letter sent to the postal address they have in HMS. 

If you decide to no longer be a member, please empty your box first. The Hackspace will buy it back from you as long as it is undamaged, however if it is not reusable the Hackspace cannot buy it back from you.

**Members must follow and agree to all rules**, and membership can be revoked through the grievance procedure.
