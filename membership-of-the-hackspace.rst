Membership of the Hackspace
===========================

Any person of the age of 18 or over can join Nottingham Hackspace, by visiting on a open night, providing correct details and setting up and maintaining a monthly payment into our nominated bank account.

Persons aged between 16 and 18 can join Nottingham Hackspace as a 'Young Hacker'. To join, the Young Hacker and their parents or guardians will need to meet with a Trustee at the Hackspace to discuss the risks within the Space.

The amount you pay into Nottingham Hackspace is your own choice, however we ask that you contribute more than you take away. For information **the average costs per hour to run the Hackspace can be seen on our** `Cost of hacking page <http://nottinghack.org.uk/tools/costposter/>`_ .

From time to time all membership contributions will be reviewed and members may be asked to increase their contribution.

Should you bring guests to the Space regularly, please **ensure your membership fees cover their access** and usage of the Hackspace.

When a member stops paying their standing order, they will become an Ex-Member. **An ex member will be provided notification of such**, and **their members box and any project will relocated** within 2 months of the last standing order payment. Nottingham Hackspace will abide by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 when disposing of any ex-member's possessions. The full termination process can be found in the Appendix C. **PROCESS TO FOLLOW**

If you decide to no longer be a member, please empty your member's box and remove any other possessions first. Nottingham Hackspace will buy your box back from you as long as it is reusable.

**Members must follow and agree to all rules**, and membership can be revoked through the complaints policy.
