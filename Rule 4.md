# No Old technology Thank You

A lot of people ask if Nottingham Hackspace needs donations of old cathode ray tube based TVs or monitors. In completely non-technical speak, that means non-flatscreens.

The answer to CRTs is always no. Take them to the tip instead. They're old, power-hungry technology, and if anyone has a use for them, we don't know who. Nowadays you generally have to pay to have someone take them away.

Other items of old technology we do not want as donations are:
- Printers
- Fax Machines
