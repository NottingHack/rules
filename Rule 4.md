# No CRTs Thank You

A lot of people ask if Nottingham Hackspace needs donations of old cathode ray tube based TVs or monitors. In completely non-technical speak, that means non-flatscreens.

The answer to CRTs is always no. Take them to the tip instead. They're old, power-hungry technology, and if anyone has a use for them, we don't know who. Nowadays you generally have to pay to have someone take them away.
