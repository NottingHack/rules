Guests & Visitors
=================

Guests & visitors are **welcome in the Hackspace**. 

A guest is someone that comes to the space with a specific member (or arranges to meet the specific member at the space).  A visitor is someone that comes to the space without a member (or arranging to meet a specific member at the space).  During Open Events the responsible Trustee for the event shall be responsible for all visitors; at all other times, when a member allows a Visitor to enter the space, the Visitor becomes that members Guest and the Member allowing a Guest or Visitor to enter the Hackspace is **wholly responsible for them for their entire visit**.

Any member bringing a guest in to the space should accompany them at all times and will be required to authenticate against any GateKeeper doors on behalf of thier guest.  This includes any GateKeeper doors that require swipe in and swipe out access.  **Please note:** your RFID card may fail to work if you swipe in, but not out, of a particular area before leaving it.

Guests cannot use tools that require an induction, such as the laser cutter, Myford lathe or 3D Printer.  If a Guest accompanies a Member while they are using one of these tools the Guest must be accompanied at all times.  If your Guest needs to leave the tool area, then you must pause your work, accompany them and provide authentication to any GateKeeper doors as required.  If your Guest wishes to leave the Hackspace independantly from yourself (for example: to go get some food and return later while you continue working) you must accompany them to the exit and authenticated to any GateKeeper doors as required.

You should not let people into the space if you don’t know them, or are unsure if they are a member. **If you do then you are responsible for them for their entire visit to the space.** 

Encourage people to authenticate to GateKeeper (by swiping their RFID card against any of the available RFID readers) if you don’t know that they are a member.  If Gatekeeper does not authenticate them you **do not have** to let the person in to the space.  Never feel obliged or intimidated to allow someone you do not know to be a member in to the space.  If they behave in a threatening or violent manner and you do not feel safe call for assistance from other members in the space or call the emergency services on 999.

Included in this are both **children** and **animals** - it is common courtesy to ask on the Google Group before attending the Hackspace with either an animal or a child. The exception to this notification is on open days and nights - members should assume that animals or children may be present at those times.

Please do not leave your animal, child or guest unattended in the Hackspace. They are your responsibility and must be attended at all times.



During Open Days and Open Evenings, all members should be aware that guests, children and animals may be roaming the Hackspace, and must be aware of this.

Please remember that **anyone**, even guests, should be challenged if you witness unsafe or rule breaking behaviour.
