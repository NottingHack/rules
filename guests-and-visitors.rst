Guests & Visitors
=================

Guests & visitors are **welcome in the Hackspace**. 

A guest is someone that comes to the space with a specific member (or arranges to meet the specific member at the space).  

A visitor is someone that comes to the space without a member (or without arranging to meet a specific member at the space).  

During Open Events the Membership Team will conduct regular tours of the space for Visitors, and ultimate responsiblity for visitors on these occasions is provided by the responsible Trustee for the given event.  At all other times, when a member allows a Visitor to enter the space, the Visitor becomes that members Guest and the Member allowing the Guest to enter the Hackspace is **wholly responsible for them for their entire visit**.

Any member bringing a guest in to the space is required by our insurance to accompany them at all times and will be required to authenticate against any GateKeeper doors on behalf of thier guest.  This includes any GateKeeper doors that require swipe in and swipe out access.  **Please note:** your RFID card may fail to work if you swipe in, but not out, of a particular area before leaving it.

If your Guest wishes to leave the Hackspace independantly from thier responsible Member (for example: to go get some food and return later while the Member continues working) the Member must accompany them to the exit and authenticate to any GateKeeper doors as required.

Guests are not insured on and cannot use **any** of the tools that require an induction, such as (but not limited to) the laser cutter, Myford lathe or 3D Printer. 

You should not let people into the space if you don’t know them, or are unsure if they are a member. If you do then they are considered your Guest and **you are responsible for them for their entire visit to the space.** 

Encourage people to authenticate to GateKeeper (by swiping their RFID card against any of the available RFID readers) if you don’t know that they are a member.  If Gatekeeper does not authenticate them you **do not have** to let the person in to the space.  Never feel obliged or intimidated to allow someone you do not know to be a member in to the space.  If they behave in a threatening or violent manner and you do not feel safe call for assistance from other members in the space or call the emergency services on 999.

Included in this are both **children** and **animals** - it is common courtesy to ask on the Google Group before attending the Hackspace with either an animal or a child. The exception to this notification is on open days and nights - members should assume that animals or children may be present at those times.

Please do not leave your animal, child or guest unattended in the Hackspace. They are your responsibility and must be attended at all times.

During Open Days and Open Evenings, all members should be aware that guests, children and animals may be roaming the Hackspace, and must be aware of this.

Please remember that **anyone**, even guests, should be challenged if you witness unsafe or rule breaking behaviour.
