Rule 6: UK Legislation
==============

Whilst in the Hackspace you must abide by all applicable UK laws and legislation.  This includes, but is not limited to:

* Health & Safety at Work, etc Act 1974
* Health Act 2006 - Smoking ban
* Illegal activity such as bringing or making explosives and offensive weaponry into the Hackspace
* Mishandling of items covered by the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006

Certain other activities are also prohibited in the space, generally as a result of conditions of our lease or our insurance. These include:

* **Vaping** (e.g. use of e-cigarettes)
* Use of **open flames** (e.g. blowtorches and other burners, candles etc.) 
* Using **portable heaters** 
* **Sleeping** in the space. This will result in a permanent ban - we have a zero tolerance policy on this. Sleeping in the space jeopardises our lease agreement, breaches fire regulations, and is a risk to your personal safety.

If you aren't sure if something is permitted within the space, please clarify with someone beforehand. Remember - illegal or otherwise forbidden activity could lead to the Hackspace being forced to shut down.

Our *Safe Spaces** (Appendix B) policy must be followed at all times.

Property is left in the Hackspace at the ownerâ€™s risk, Nottingham Hackspace accepts no liability for lost or stolen items.
