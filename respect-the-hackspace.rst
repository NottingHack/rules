Respect the Hackspace
=====================

We ask that you respect the Hackspace. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself**, by being careful not to **damage infrastructure** and by **reporting both damaged/broken tools and infrastructure**.

Please report broken/damaged tools and infrastructure to <maintainers@nottinghack.org.uk>. We are aware accidents happen, and no member should ever be penalised for accidentally breaking a tool.

We also ask that you do not **borrow** tools and remember that the Hackspace is a shared space.

We remind you that whilst we have no issue with you using the tools and the Hackspace to further your business endeavours, that the Hackspace should not be the prime means or location  your business, whether in production or end-to-end operation.

We **do not** guarantee uptime on tools at the Hackspace.

We ask that you **do not arrange deliveries** to the Hackspace, as there is no delivery access for the building.

Part of respect for the space includes not doing anything in the space that would put the space or other members at risk of loss or punishment; for the avoidance of doubt this includes obaying all uk laws when in the space.
