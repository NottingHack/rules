Be Excellent To One Another
===========================

We ask that you respect others when using the Space. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself** and abiding by our **safe spaces** policy in Appendix B.

There are housekeeping tasks that always need doing, and can be completed by any member. Please see this wiki page for more details.

Please make yourself aware of our **complaints policy** (Appendix A).

Remember that Nottingham Hackspace is run by the volunteers for the members, and we ask that you be a **member not a consumer**. Don’t be a greedy hacker.
