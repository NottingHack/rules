Rule 0: Do Not Be On Fire
=========================

It is essential you use the space safely as a responsible adult, if you feel like it.

We encourage members to challenge **unsafe storage** by other members. If you do not feel comfortable challenging a member, we welcome emails to the safety@nottinghack.org.uk email address.

Wearing **safety gear** at the Hackspace is your own responsibility. We will provide appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and we ask if you notice any low supplies please email safety@nottinghack.org.uk.

We encourage the **safe use of tools** and you must self certify that you are comfortable using a tool - except in the case of tools requiring an induction, where the inductor will certify you have been fully inducted.

The Hackspace abides by **The Health & Safety at Work Act**, and points out that you also have responsibilities under this legislation, such as taking reasonable care of othersâ€™ safety when operating tools and machinery.

When you are working on your own in the Hackspace, **please use the Lone Worker Alarm**. **Please note** this does not contact 999, in case of genuine emergencies you should first ring the emergency services. The official address for the Hackspace is written on various posters and boards throughout the Hackspace.
