# Don't just *try* to clean up after yourself

Aim to clean up a little bit more mess than you make, because we all miss things from time to time, and mess builds up.

The Space employs a cleaner to look after the Studio, Kitchen, Toilets and Comfy Area, however this does not mean they do not need regular deep cleaning and tidying. 

The Workshop is wholly the responsibility of the Hackspace members.
