Nottingham Hackspace Rules - Draft
==================================

Welcome to the Nottingham Hackspace Rules. This contains the rules to which every member and guest of the space is expected to follow.

Below is a summary of the rules, each has its own full description that can be accessed via the menu on the left.


0. Rule 0: Do Not Be On Fire
    It is essential you use the space safely as a responsible adult.
1. Membership of the Hackspace
    Any person of the age of 18 can join the hackspace, by visiting on a open night, providing correct details and setting up and maintaining a monthly payment into our nominated bank account.
2. Guests & Visitors
    Guests & visitors are **welcome in the Hackspace**, however whoever brings them into the space or lets them into the space is **wholly responsible for them**.
3. Be Excellent To One Another
    We ask that you respect others when using the Hackspace. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself**, abiding by our **safe spaces** policy and **code of conduct**.
4. Respect the Hackspace
    We ask that you respect the Hackspace. Do this by **cleaning up after yourself**, by being careful not to **damage infrastructure** and by **reporting both damaged/broken tools and infrastructure**.
5. Do Not Hack
    Do Not Hack is an integral part of the Hackspace. Do Not Hack means you are claiming materials, a donation or a project as your own, and requesting that no other members 'hack' the component parts.
6. UK Legislation
    Whilst in the Hackspace you must abide by all applicable UK laws and legislation.
7. Storage in the Hackspace
    Remember that the **Hackspace has limited storage space**. We have designated storage space for **consumables, resources** and **members’ storage**.
8. Donating to the Hackspace
    **Consider the benefit to the Hackspace** when making a donation. Do this by posting your items and offers to the Google Group. Is there a general consensus from the members about its use or usefulness?
