Welcome to the Nottingham Hackspace Rules. This contains the rules to which every member and guest of the space is expected to follow.

Below is a summary of the rules, each has its own full description that can be accessed via the menu on the left.


0. Rule 0: Do Not Be On Fire
    It is essential you use the Space safely as a responsible adult.
1. Membership of the Hackspace
    Any person aged 18 or over can join Nottingham Hackspace, by visiting on a open night, providing correct details, and setting up and maintaining a monthly payment into our nominated bank account.
