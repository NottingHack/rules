Nottingham Hackspace Rules
==========================

Welcome to the Nottingham Hackspace Rules. This contains the rules to which every member and guest of the space is expected to follow. They do not define what you can do, only what you must not do.  All members are expected to have an awareness of the rules, and confirm that they are understood when becoming a member. If you're ever unsure, you should always ask, either by emailing the trustees, or by asking on Discord in the appropriate channel.

There are nine core rules,

- Rule 0: `Do Not Be On Fire <do-not-be-on-fire.html>`_
- Rule 1: `Membership of the Hackspace <membership-of-the-hackspace.html>`_
- Rule 2: `Guests & Visitors <guests-and-visitors.html>`_
- Rule 3: `Be Excellent to One Another <be-excellent-to-one-another.html>`_
- Rule 4: `Respect the Hackspace <respect-the-hackspace.html>`_
- Rule 5: `Do Not Hack <do-not-hack.html>`_
- Rule 6: `UK Legislation <uk-legislation.html>`_
- Rule 7: `Storage in the Hackspace <storage-in-the-hackspace.html>`_
- Rule 8: `Donating Items to Nottingham Hackspace <donating-to-nottingham-hackspace.html>`_

Additionally, there are four appendices,

- Appendix A: `Complaints Policy <complaints-policy.html>`_
- Appendix B: `SafeSpaces Policy <safespaces.html>`_
- Appendix C: `Discord Policy <discord.html>`_
- Appendix D: `GDPR and Privacy Policy <privacy.html>`_

We also maintain a `list of definitions <definitions.html>`_.
