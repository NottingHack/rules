Storage in the Hackspace
========================

Remember that the **Hackspace has limited storage space**. We have designated storage space for **consumables, resources** and **members’ storage**.

Members are entitled to a **35l storage box**. You can buy a box from any of the Membership Team or Trustees for £5. You must label your box with an identifiable name - any name is fine as long as we can identify the owner by it. A current, up-to-date contact method (such as email) is also useful to get in touch quickly.

If you are working on a project that is too large for a 35l box you can store it on the Large Project Shelves. It can be stored there whilst it is actively being worked on, and must always be labelled according to our **Do Not Hack** rules.

If your project is too big for the Large Project Shelves, a storage request must be made on the Google Group.

If you wish to **store solvents**, they must be stored in the members’ section of the solvents cupboard. Please see **Rule 0** for details.

If you use the **spray booth**, you can of course leave your project to dry in the spray booth for up to 24 hours, however please ensure it is labelled with a Do Not Hack sign as well as being aware it may need to be moved to accommodate use of the booth.

Chemicals, solvents and flammables must always be labelled and kept in appropriate, sealed containers. Flammable liquids (oils, solvents, cleaning fluids etc.) should be kept in the **solvents cupboard**.
