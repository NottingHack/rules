Storage in the Hackspace
========================

Remember that the **Hackspace has limited storage space**. We have designated storage space for **consumables, resources** and **members’ storage**.

As storage is a premium in the Hackspace Members are allowed to use the Member Storage and Large Storage areas as long as they abide by the **Membership of the Hackspace** rule and do not take more from the Hackspace than they contribute.  It's important to remember that a Members contribution is only partly formed by their monthly payment.  Members may contribute to the space in other ways, such as with thier time and effort on one of the Teams that helps keep the Hackspace running.

Members are entitled to a **35l storage box** which can be bought at cost from any of the Membership Team or Trustees for £5. You must label your box with your full name - pseudonyms are not allowed, but may be added alongside your full name. A contact method (such as email) is also appreciated on the label, to help identify the owner of a box.  Members requiring more than box should enquire directly with the Membership Team.

If you are working on a project that is too large for a 35l box you can store it on the Large Project Shelves. It can be stored there whilst it is actively being worked on, and must always be labelled according to our **Do Not Hack** rules.

If your project is too big for the Large Project Shelves, a storage request must be made on the Google Group.

If you wish to **store solvents**, they must be stored in the members’ section of the solvents cupboard. Please see **Rule 0** for details.

If you use the **spray booth**, you can leave your project to dry in the spray booth for up to 24 hours, however please ensure it is labelled with a Do Not Hack sign as well as being aware it may need to be moved to accommodate use of the booth.

Chemicals, solvents and flammables must always be labelled and kept in appropriate, sealed containers. Flammable liquids (oils, solvents, cleaning fluids etc.) should be kept in the **solvents cupboard**.
