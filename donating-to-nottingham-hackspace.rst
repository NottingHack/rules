Donating Items to Nottingham Hackspace
======================================

**Consider the benefit to Nottingham Hackspace** when making a donation. Please consider the following:

* Does it increase the value of the space?
* Will more than a few members make use of the donation?
* Do we have space for the item?
* Does it pose any risks to the space (e.g. highly flammable or risk to health)?

If you still think the item would be worth donation, please post in the most appropriate channel on Discord. Team members and trustees will make the final decision as to whether the item can / should be donated.

Remember that the Hackspace has **limited storage space**. Don’t bring in things without asking or checking.
