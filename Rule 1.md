# Pay-What-You-Like But Pay Monthly

This is the Nottingham Hackspace membership-fees rule.

## Pay what you like

* Membership is based on making a financial contribution to the space.
* Your contribution should be just a little more than you take from the space in terms of use, consumables, WiFi & most importantly enjoyment!
* The Hackspace is NOT run on grants, handouts or other external funding. It is run on membership payments and the money made from workshops. Donations of money will only ever be used for buying tools & equipment.
* If you are taking more from the space than you are giving you will be politely asked to increase your monthly payment.
* Members are also expected to cover the Hackspace usage of their guests.

## Pay monthly

* Members make a payment by Standing Order into the Nottinghack bank account. This payment should be received on a monthly basis. Members should always use the reference provided to them when they register interest in the Hackspace. We may be unable to match your payment to your record with an incorrect reference.
* Members who do not pay by standing order or miss payments for more than one month will not be informed of changes door codes or WiFi keys.
* Members who continue to attend Hackspace but have not made membership payments will be reminded to pay and ultimately excluded from the membership benefits.
