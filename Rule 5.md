# DO NOT HACK means DO NOT HACK

This rule is put there with the aim of people's projects not getting damaged or misused.

## Objects In the Hackspace:

Some things are obviously not to be hacked, like tools and bits of infrastructure. Sometimes the presence of an object is ambiguous though. Do Not Hack signs are a simple way of disambiguating them, and protecting your projects from the awesome ideas of others.

There are all kinds of reasons for projects to be around the space; for instance some are too big to go in a member's box, or something might be a part-built piece of hackspace infrastructure. If it's not in a materials store or a consumables box, then assume it's not for hacking. It's possible that something not in materials storage or a consumables box IS available for hacking, but you should make sure first.

## Protecting Your Projects:

When you've started work on something and it might be ambiguous that others aren't to mess with it, put a do not hack sign on it. For instance, you've found the perfect piece of board to make a mug rack later that week, or you've built a piece of furniture but need to store it until you've got time to finish the wood. For something so unfinished, it might be easy for another hacker to assume it can be used for something or even consumed as material for a different project.

A project must be stored on the Large Project Shelves if it is too large for your member's box. Projects on the Large Project Shelves must be labelled with your name, and the date the project was last worked on. This information must also be detailed on the sheet attached to the side of the shelving unit.

Projects that are not correctly labelled may be moved to the donations area. Projects that have not been dated in 6 months may be moved to the donations area.

Some tips:

* Attach the sign to the project with tape or something. Make sure the sign itself is prominent and can't easily go missing.
* Put your name on the sign and contact details. If someone needs to ask about it, or something happens to your stuff, this will make things a lot easier.
* Store your stuff in a way that mitigates possible damage. Bubble wrap and cardboard are cheap ways to shield your project from things going on in the space, and if you know it'll be there for a while it's well worth packing it like this.
